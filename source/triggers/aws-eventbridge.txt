Overview
--------

MongoDB offers an `AWS Eventbridge
<https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/>`_ partner event source that lets
you send Atlas Trigger events to an event bus instead of
calling an Atlas Function. You can configure any Trigger to send events to
EventBridge.

All you need to send Trigger events to EventBridge is an AWS account ID.
This guide walks through finding your account ID, configuring the
Trigger, and associating the Trigger event source with an event bus.

.. note:: Official AWS Partner Event Source Guide
   
   This guide is based on Amazon's :aws-docs:`Receiving Events from a
   SaaS Partner
   </eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-partner-event-bus.html>`
   documentation.

Procedure
---------

.. note::

   The AWS put entry for an EventBridge trigger event must be smaller than 256 KB.
   
   :ref:`Learn how to reduce the size of your PutEvents entry in the Performance Optimization 
   section. <send-aws-eventbridge-performance-optimization>` 

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Begin Setup of the MongoDB Partner Event Source

      To send trigger events to AWS EventBridge, you need the :guilabel:`AWS
      account ID` of the account that should receive the events.
      Open the `Amazon EventBridge console
      <https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/>`_ and click
      :guilabel:`Partner event sources` in the navigation menu. Search for
      the :guilabel:`MongoDB` partner event source and then click
      :guilabel:`Set up`.

      On the :guilabel:`MongoDB` partner event source page, click
      :guilabel:`Copy` to copy your AWS account ID to the clipboard.

   .. step:: Configure the Trigger

      Once you have the :guilabel:`AWS account ID`, you can configure a
      trigger to send events to EventBridge.

      .. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

         .. tab::
            :tabid: ui

            In the App Services UI, create and configure a new :doc:`database
            trigger </triggers/database-triggers>`, :doc:`authentication
            trigger </triggers/authentication-triggers>`, or :doc:`scheduled
            trigger </triggers/scheduled-triggers>` and select the
            :guilabel:`EventBridge` event type.

            Paste in the :guilabel:`AWS Account ID` that you copied from
            EventBridge and select an :guilabel:`AWS Region` to send the trigger events
            to.

            Optionally, you can configure an error function for custom error handling.
            For more details, see the next section on 
            :ref:`Custom Error Handling <eventbridge_error_handling>`.

            .. figure:: /images/eventbridge-trigger-config.png
               :alt: The EventBridge input boxes in the trigger configuration.

            By default, triggers convert the BSON types in event objects into 
            standard JSON types. To preserve BSON type information, you can 
            serialize event objects into :manual:`Extended JSON format 
            </reference/mongodb-extended-json>` instead. Extended JSON preserves type 
            information at the expense of readability and interoperability.
            
            To enable Extended JSON, 
            click the :guilabel:`Enable Extended JSON` toggle in the 
            :guilabel:`Advanced (Optional)` section.

         .. tab::
            :tabid: cli

            Create a :ref:`trigger configuration file <legacy-appschema-triggers>`
            in the ``/triggers`` directory. Omit the ``function_name`` field
            and define an ``AWS_EVENTBRIDGE`` event processor.

            Set the ``account_id`` field to the :guilabel:`AWS Account ID`
            that you copied from EventBridge and set the ``region`` field to
            an AWS Region. 
            
            By default, triggers convert the BSON types in event objects into 
            standard JSON types. To preserve BSON type information, you can 
            serialize event objects into :manual:`Extended JSON format 
            </reference/mongodb-extended-json>` instead. Extended JSON preserves type 
            information at the expense of readability and interoperability.
            
            To enable Extended JSON, set the ``extended_json_enabled`` field to ``true``.

            The trigger configuration file should resemble the following:

            .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "name": "...",
                 "type": "...",
                 "event_processors": {
                    "AWS_EVENTBRIDGE": {
                        "config": {
                           "account_id": "<AWS Account ID>",
                           "region": "<AWS Region>",
                           "extended_json_enabled": <boolean>
                        }
                     }
                  }
               }

      .. note:: Supported AWS Regions

         For a full list of supported AWS regions, refer to Amazon's
         :aws-docs:`Receiving Events from a SaaS Partner
         </eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-partner-event-bus.html>`
         guide.


   .. step:: Associate the Trigger Event Source with an Event Bus

      Go back to the EventBridge console and choose Partner event sources in
      the navigation pane. In the :guilabel:`Partner event sources` table,
      find and select the :guilabel:`Pending` trigger source and then click
      :guilabel:`Associate with event bus`.

      On the :guilabel:`Associate with event bus` screen, define any
      required access permissions for other accounts and organizations and
      then click :guilabel:`Associate`.

      Once confirmed, the status of the trigger event source changes from
      :guilabel:`Pending` to :guilabel:`Active`, and the name of the event
      bus updates to match the event source name. You can now start creating
      rules that trigger on events from that partner event source. For more
      information, see :aws-docs:`Creating a Rule That Triggers on a SaaS Partner Event </eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-rule-partner-events.html>`.

.. _eventbridge_error_handling:

Custom Error Handling
---------------------

.. note:: Custom Error Handling Does Not Support Authentication and Scheduled Triggers

   Custom error handling supports only database triggers. 
   Authentication triggers and scheduled triggers are not supported. 

.. figure:: /images/eventbridge-error-handling-diagram.png
   :alt: EventBridge Custom Error Handling Flow Diagram.

You can create an error function to be executed on a trigger failure, 
when retry does not succeed. Custom error handling allows you to determine
whether an error from AWS EventBridge is critical enough to suspend the Trigger,
or if it is acceptable to ignore the error and continue processing other events.

Create a New Custom Error Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. figure:: /images/eventbridge-custom-function.png
         :alt: The EventBridge custom error handling configuration.

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Create a New Error Handling Function

            In the :guilabel:`Configure Error Fucntion` section, select 
            :guilabel:`+ New Function`.

         .. step:: Name the New Function

            Enter a unique, identifying name for the function in the :guilabel:`Name` field. 
            This name must be distinct from all other functions in the application.

         .. step:: Write the Function Code

            In the :guilabel:`Function` section, write the function in the function editor.
            In the function editor, you will see a default function. You can edit
            the function as needed. 

         .. step:: Test the Function

            In the :guilabel:`Testing Console` tab beneath the function editor, you can
            test the function by passing in an example ``error`` and ``changeEvent``. Click
            :guilabel:`Run` to run the test. 

         .. step:: Save the Function

            Once you are satisfied with the custom error handling function, click
            :guilabel:`Save`. 

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      Add an ``error_handler`` attribute to your trigger configuration file. 
      The trigger configuration file should resemble the following:

      .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "name": "...",
                 "type": "...",
                 "event_processors": {
                    "AWS_EVENTBRIDGE": {
                        "config": {
                           "account_id": "<AWS Account ID>",
                           "region": "<AWS Region>",
                           "extended_json_enabled": <boolean>
                        }
                     }
                  },
                  "error_handler": {
                     "config": {
                        "enabled": <boolean>,
                        "function_name": "<Error Handler Function Name>"
                     }
                  }
               }

      To learn how to update your app with this new configuration, see
      :ref:`Update an App <deploy-cli>`.

Error Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~

If an error was recevied from EventBridge, the event processor will parse the 
error as either ``DOCUMENT_TOO_LARGE`` or ``OTHER``. This parsed error is passed
to the error handle function. 

``DOCUMENT_TOO_LARGE``
``````````````````````
If the put entry for an EventBridge trigger event is larger
than 256 KB, Eventbridge will throw an error. The error will either contain:

1.  `status code: 400 <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400>`_ and 
``total size of the entries in the request is over the limit``.

2. `status code: 413 <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/413>`_, 
which indicates a too large payload. 

``OTHER``
`````````
The default bucket for all other errors.

Error Logs
~~~~~~~~~~

You can view error logs for your Event Bridge Trigger error handler in the 
application logs. 

 .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      1. Click ``Logs`` in the left navigation of the App Services UI.

      2. Click the :guilabel:`Filter by Type` dropdown and select
      both :guilabel:`Triggers` and :guilabel:`Error Handlers` to view
      logs for the Trigger error handler.

      :tabid: cli

      Use the ``trigger`` and ``errorhandler`` ``--type`` flags to 
      view logs for the Trigger error handler.

      .. code-block:: shell
         
         {+cli-bin+} logs list --type=trigger --type=errorhandler
