Overview
--------

MongoDB offers an `AWS Eventbridge
<https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/>`_ partner event source that lets
you send Atlas Trigger events to an event bus instead of
calling an Atlas Function. You can configure any Trigger type to send events to
EventBridge. Database Triggers also support custom error handling,
to reduce trigger suspensions due to non-critical errors. 

All you need to send Trigger events to EventBridge is an AWS account ID.
This guide walks through finding your account ID, configuring the
Trigger, associating the Trigger event source with an event bus, and setting
up custom error handling.

.. note:: Official AWS Partner Event Source Guide
   
   This guide is based on Amazon's :aws-docs:`Receiving Events from a
   SaaS Partner
   </eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-partner-event-bus.html>`
   documentation.

Procedure
---------

.. note::

   The AWS put entry for an EventBridge trigger event must be smaller than 256 KB.
   
   Learn how to reduce the size of your PutEvents entry in the :ref:`Performance Optimization 
   <send-aws-eventbridge-performance-optimization>` section.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Set Up the MongoDB Partner Event Source 

      To send trigger events to AWS EventBridge, you need the :guilabel:`AWS
      account ID` of the account that should receive the events.
      Open the `Amazon EventBridge console
      <https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/>`_ and click
      :guilabel:`Partner event sources` in the navigation menu. Search for
      the :guilabel:`MongoDB` partner event source and then click
      :guilabel:`Set up`.

      On the :guilabel:`MongoDB` partner event source page, click
      :guilabel:`Copy` to copy your AWS account ID to the clipboard.

   .. step:: Configure the Trigger

      Once you have the :guilabel:`AWS account ID`, you can configure a
      trigger to send events to EventBridge.

      .. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

         .. tab::
            :tabid: ui

            In the App Services UI, create and configure a new :doc:`database
            trigger </triggers/database-triggers>`, :doc:`authentication
            trigger </triggers/authentication-triggers>`, or :doc:`scheduled
            trigger </triggers/scheduled-triggers>` and select the
            :guilabel:`EventBridge` event type.

            Paste in the :guilabel:`AWS Account ID` that you copied from
            EventBridge and select an :guilabel:`AWS Region` to send the trigger events
            to.

            Optionally, you can configure an error function for custom error handling.
            For more details, refer to :ref:`Custom Error Handling <eventbridge_error_handling>`
            section on this page.

            .. figure:: /images/eventbridge-trigger-config.png
               :alt: The EventBridge input boxes in the trigger configuration.

            By default, triggers convert the BSON types in event objects into 
            standard JSON types. To preserve BSON type information, you can 
            serialize event objects into :manual:`Extended JSON format 
            </reference/mongodb-extended-json>` instead. Extended JSON preserves type 
            information at the expense of readability and interoperability.
            
            To enable Extended JSON, 
            click the :guilabel:`Enable Extended JSON` toggle in the 
            :guilabel:`Advanced (Optional)` section.

         .. tab::
            :tabid: cli

            Create a :ref:`trigger configuration file <legacy-appschema-triggers>`
            in the ``/triggers`` directory. Omit the ``function_name`` field
            and define an ``AWS_EVENTBRIDGE`` event processor.

            Set the ``account_id`` field to the :guilabel:`AWS Account ID`
            that you copied from EventBridge and set the ``region`` field to
            an AWS Region. 
            
            By default, triggers convert the BSON types in event objects into 
            standard JSON types. To preserve BSON type information, you can 
            serialize event objects into :manual:`Extended JSON format 
            </reference/mongodb-extended-json>` instead. Extended JSON preserves type 
            information at the expense of readability and interoperability.
            
            To enable Extended JSON, set the ``extended_json_enabled`` field to ``true``.

            Optionally, you can configure a function for handling trigger errors.
            Custom error handling is only valid for database triggers. 
            For more details, refer to the :ref:`Custom Error Handling <eventbridge_error_handling>`
            section on this page.

            The trigger configuration file should resemble the following:

            .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "name": "...",
                 "type": "...",
                 "event_processors": {
                    "AWS_EVENTBRIDGE": {
                        "config": {
                           "account_id": "<AWS Account ID>",
                           "region": "<AWS Region>",
                           "extended_json_enabled": <boolean>
                        }
                     }
                  }
               }

      .. note:: Supported AWS Regions

         For a full list of supported AWS regions, refer to Amazon's
         :aws-docs:`Receiving Events from a SaaS Partner
         </eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-partner-event-bus.html>`
         guide.


   .. step:: Associate the Trigger Event Source with an Event Bus

      Go back to the EventBridge console and choose Partner event sources in
      the navigation pane. In the :guilabel:`Partner event sources` table,
      find and select the :guilabel:`Pending` trigger source and then click
      :guilabel:`Associate with event bus`.

      On the :guilabel:`Associate with event bus` screen, define any
      required access permissions for other accounts and organizations and
      then click :guilabel:`Associate`.

      Once confirmed, the status of the trigger event source changes from
      :guilabel:`Pending` to :guilabel:`Active`, and the name of the event
      bus updates to match the event source name. You can now start creating
      rules that trigger on events from that partner event source. For more
      information, see :aws-docs:`Creating a Rule That Triggers on a SaaS Partner Event </eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-rule-partner-events.html>`.

.. _eventbridge-error-handling:

Custom Error Handling
---------------------

.. note:: Only Database Triggers Support Custom Error Handlers

   Currently, only database triggers support custom error handling. 
   Authentication triggers and scheduled triggers do not support 
   custom error handling at this time. 

.. figure:: /images/eventbridge-error-handling-diagram.png
   :alt: EventBridge Custom Error Handling Flow Diagram.

You can create an error handler to be executed on a trigger failure, 
when retry does not succeed. Custom error handling allows you to determine
whether an error from AWS EventBridge is critical enough to suspend the Trigger,
or if it is acceptable to ignore the error and continue processing other events.
For more information on suspended databse triggers, refer to 
:ref:`Suspended Triggers <suspended_triggers>`.

Create a New Custom Error Handler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. figure:: /images/eventbridge-custom-function.png
         :alt: The EventBridge custom error handling configuration in the UI.

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Create a New Error Handler

            In the :guilabel:`Configure Error Function` section, select 
            :guilabel:`+ New Function`.

            You can also select an existing Function, if one is already defined,  
            from the dropdown. For more information, see 
            :ref:`Define a Function <define-a-function>`.

         .. step:: Name the New Function

            Enter a unique, identifying name for the function in the :guilabel:`Name` field. 
            This name must be distinct from all other functions in the application.

         .. step:: Write the Function Code

            In the :guilabel:`Function` section, write the function in the function editor.
            In the function editor, you will see a default function. You can edit
            the function as needed. 

         .. step:: Test the Function

            In the :guilabel:`Testing Console` tab beneath the function editor, you can
            test the function by passing in example values to the ``error`` and 
            ``changeEvent`` parameters, as shown in the comments of the testing console. 

            For more information on these paramaters, refer to the 
            :ref:`Error Handler Parameters <eventbridge-error-handler-parameters>`
            section on this page.

            Click :guilabel:`Run` to run the test. 

         .. step:: Save the Function

            Once you are satisfied with the custom error handler, click
            :guilabel:`Save`. 

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      In order to update your trigger's configuration with an error handler, 
      follow these steps to :ref:`Update an App  <deploy-cli>`. When you
      update your configuration files in Step 3, do the following:

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Write the Error Handler

            Follow the steps in :ref:`Define a Function <define-a-function>` 
            to write your error handler source code and configuration file. 

            For the error handler source code, see the following template error handler:

            .. code-block:: js
               :caption: <functionName>.js
               
               exports = async function(error, changeEvent) {
                  // This sample function will log additional details if the error is not
                  // a DOCUMENT_TOO_LARGE error
                  if (error.code === 'DOCUMENT_TOO_LARGE') {
                     console.log('Document too large error');

                     // Comment out the line below in order to skip this event and not suspend the Trigger
                     throw new Error(`Encountered error: ${error.code}`);
                  }

                  console.log('Error sending event to EventBridge');
                  console.log(`DB: ${changeEvent.ns.db}`);
                  console.log(`Collection: ${changeEvent.ns.coll}`);
                  console.log(`Operation type: ${changeEvent.operationType}`);

                  // Throw an error in your function to suspend the trigger and stop processing additional events
                  throw new Error(`Encountered error: ${error.message}`);
               };

         .. step:: Add an Error Handler to Your Trigger Configuration

            Add an ``error_handler`` attribute to your trigger configuration file
            in the ``Triggers`` folder. The trigger configuration file should 
            resemble the following:

            .. code-block:: json
               :emphasize-lines: 13-18

                     {
                     "name": "...",
                     "type": "...",
                     "event_processors": {
                        "AWS_EVENTBRIDGE": {
                              "config": {
                                 "account_id": "<AWS Account ID>",
                                 "region": "<AWS Region>",
                                 "extended_json_enabled": <boolean>
                              }
                           }
                        },
                        "error_handler": {
                           "config": {
                              "enabled": <boolean>,
                              "function_name": "<Error Handler Function Name>"
                           }
                        }
                     }
            
            For more information on trigger configuration files, see
            :ref:`Trigger Configuration Files <appconfig-triggers>`.

.. _eventbridge-error-handler-parameters:

Error Handler Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default error handler has two parameters: ``error`` and ``changeEvent``.

``error`` 
`````````
Has the following two attributes:

- ``code``: The code for the errored EventBridge put request. For a list of 
  error codes used by the error handler, see the below section. 

- ``message``: The unfiltered error message from an errored EventBridge
  put request.

``changeEvent``
```````````````

The requested change to your data made by EventBridge. For more information
on types of change events and their configurations, see 
:ref:`Change Event Types <database-events>`.

.. _eventbridge-error-codes:

Error Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~

If an error was recevied from EventBridge, the event processor will parse the 
error as either ``DOCUMENT_TOO_LARGE`` or ``OTHER``. This parsed error is passed
to the error handler function through the ``error`` parameter. 

``DOCUMENT_TOO_LARGE``
``````````````````````
If the put entry for an EventBridge trigger event is larger
than 256 KB, EventBridge will throw an error. The error will contain either:

- `status code: 400 <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400>`_ and ``total size of the entries 
   in the request is over the limit``.

- `status code: 413 <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/413>`_, 
   which indicates a too large payload. 

For more information on reducing put entry size, see the below :ref:`Performance 
Optimization <send-aws-eventbridge-performance-optimization>` section.

``OTHER``
`````````
The default bucket for all other errors.

.. tip:: Optimize Error Handling for Errors with ``OTHER`` Code

   You can make special error handling cases for 
   your most common error messages to optimize your error handling for 
   errors with an ``OTHER`` code. To determine which errors need 
   special cases, we recommended keeping track of 
   the most common error messages you receive in ``error.message``. 

Error Handler Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view logs for your EventBridge Trigger error handler in the 
application logs. 

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      1. Click ``Logs`` in the left navigation of the App Services UI.

      2. Click the :guilabel:`Filter by Type` dropdown and select
         :guilabel:`Triggers Error Handlers` to view all error handler 
         logs for the App.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      Pass the ``trigger_error_handler`` value to the ``--type`` flag to 
      view all error handler logs for the App.

      .. code-block:: shell
