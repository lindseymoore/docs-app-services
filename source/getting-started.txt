The resources on this page are designed to help you explore Atlas App 
Services. To explore a working codebase that showcases App Services' 
features, check out a Template App. For a more guided experience in
learning how to develop with App Services and Realm, start with a 
Tutorial.


Template Apps
-------------

Bootstrap App Services with a Template App. Template apps bring together
many of the building blocks available in Atlas App Services and start you 
off with a prebuilt app that you can customize. 

- A mobile todo app written with Realm SDKs that syncs to an App Services App
- A hosted todo web app using the GraphQL API or Realm Web SDK
- An Event-driven :doc:`Database Trigger </triggers/database-triggers>` 
  template that updates a view in a separate collection.

Tutorials
---------

Unlike Template Apps, which provide a pre-built app to explore by 
yourself, Tutorials provide a detailed step-by-step guide to developing 
apps that use App Services features.
